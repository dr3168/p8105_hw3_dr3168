#There are 1, 384, 617 observations with 15 variables. Some of these variables include order IDs, product IDs, and name of products.  
```

Counting amount of aisles
```{r}

#There are 134 aisles.
```

Finding most popular aisles
```{r}
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
    filter(min_rank(desc(n)) < 4)

#The top three aisles with the most purchases is fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, and packaged vegetables and fruits.

Loading accelerometer data

Making Total activity variable

view(accel_total_activity)

#The total activity varies from day to day but I have not seen a trend. It is also very difficult to see if there is a trend with the table. A plot may be better.

```
Making the table with total activity
```{r}
accel_total_activity %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

Making a single panel plot
```{r}
accel_tidy_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = activity_minute, y = activity_count,
             group=day_id, color=day)) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(group=day), se=F)
#The activity count started off real slow but throughout the day it starts to increase. Then it significantly drops towards approaching the 1400th minute. This correlated with awake-status. The patient most likely wont be awake around midnight, therefore the activity count is low. However the person will be wide awake and moving throughout the day, hence is higher activity count.
